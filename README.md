# Rwandahydroclimatology
The aim of this project is to characterize Rwanda's hydroclimate, specifically focusing on precipitation and temperature patterns, 
and their impact on both agriculture and regions with high population density. 
The primary outcome of this project will be the development of a web dashboard using Plotly Dash in Python.
